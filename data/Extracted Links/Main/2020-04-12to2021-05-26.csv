There is an international effort to invest in data capture and analysis methodologies and technologies for LMICs so they can better respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Yet development organizations worry that some of these digital tools come with: •	Significant privacy and security implications •	Under-represent of certain populations •	Undermine existing data-reporting structures How can solution providers and development organizations include clear standards and core ICT4D approaches as they select, design, and implement digital development technology? £500,000 DFID Grant Funding The DFID Frontier Technologies Hub COVID Action Data Challenge invites you to submit data innovations that can support LMICs with up to £50,000 per solution in the following categories: •	Data-use solutions that support data integration and analysis •	Data sources and collection tools that inform response •	Epidemiological modelling to support response and planning •	Responsible data needs in COVID-19 data systems Selected applicants can receive a mix of support, including grant funding for rapid deployment and matchmaking with DFID and other donors for additional resources at a virtual showcase on or around 20 May, 2020.  #COVIDAction Apply Now! Deadline is May 9, 2020 https://medium.com/frontier-technology-livestreaming/apply-now-data-challenge-for-covidaction-9de45cbe37f",https://medium.com/frontier-technology-livestreaming/apply-now-data-challenge-for-covidaction-9de45cbe37f

The system uses its own currency the Q and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago you wouldn't want to miss this.  Here is my invite link: https://initiativeq.com/invite/HEOVFhEa7  This link will stop working once I’m out of invites.

9473,2020-07-24 12:21:00, Olayinka," #PaperReview   It's been a while. I had to take a short break to balance some things. It's good to be back.   This week I read the paper titled: “Measuring patient-perceived quality of care in US hospitals using Twitter” by Jared Hawkins, et al. {2015).  It was a lovely read. One thing I took away from the paper is that hospitals need to start looking at Twitter data as a useful measure for supplementing traditional approaches of assessing and improving quality of care - from the patients perspective.

FGM Type 1 is the most common one. Also 4 countries out of 17 countries in Africa usually involve in re-infibulation of Type 3. Check my post on medium or LinkedIn to read more. Don't forget to like drop a comment and share.  Notes: FGM is different from circumcision. FGM is condemned by all religions while Islam makes circumcision optional (from what I read and understand) for females. However, many people deliberately or not do mix them together. FGM is against human's right as positioned by UNICEF because it comes with a lot of risk for females.

Please see the job description below and fill the form that follows if you are interested in the opportunity.   Job Description:   What We Do:  Tsaron Tech is a telematics company building a scorecard system to help auto insurers determine what's good or bad driver behaviour. Bad drivers pay dearer premium or receive fewer benefits.  Why We Need the Data Scientist:  We recently completed a noncommercial test run with continental auto insurers. We need the detailed data scientist to test and structure thought frameworks out of datasets generated from the test run against a research-focused metric we're working on for the scorecard system. This metric is one out of several others we're tracking & building for the scorecard system. The data scientist will likewise work with auto analysts and software engineers on these other metrics. However, the focus of this engagement is the research-focused metric and the goal of the engagement is empirically establishing through data modeling the metric as a standard in the scorecard system.  What Makes a Hire:  The position is an open offer. Tsaron Tech will offer employment to the first data scientist to empirically establish through data modeling the metric as a standard in the scorecard system.
