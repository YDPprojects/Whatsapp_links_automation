20141,2021-07-27 15:39:00, Fabiyi Opeyemi, Read both books like a buffet 😂😂 else you get bored of it.  Start with the Kimball one I just start am yesterday.  Kimball is called the Father of Data Warehouse because he started the whole Dimension modelling idea stuff.   Use this guide from this blog on how to read the book  https://www.holistics.io/blog/how-to-read-data-warehouse-toolkit/  Though some of the ideas there from my research won't apply again as a result of the advent of MPP & ELT approach to DW but the fundamental knowledge of Dimensional modelling still valid.  So you may need to scheme through some sections,https://www.holistics.io/blog/how-to-read-data-warehouse-toolkit/

25574,2021-09-19 17:08:00, Fabiyi Opeyemi," *```The Maiden edition of dbt Meetup in Nigeria*```   The Modern Data stack and the rise of Analytics Engineering isn't just some random speculation, instead, it's gradually becoming a highly sought after skill every organization would need to stay relevant in coming years.   Becoming a Data Engineer can be quite tedious with a high learning curve compared to becoming an Analytics Engineer. Fortunately, Data analyst and data scientist are at an advantage as they can easily pick up the AE stack leveraging on their existing Analytics knowledge which would ensure a seemless integration into the Analytics Engineering role.   It's exciting to know that with the advent of an amazing tool like dbt, data analysts and engineers can now build analytics the way engineers build applications.  In the light of this, We are super excited  to announce the start off of dbt meetup here in Nigeria, which is dedicated to helping data analyst and all data professionals own thier analytics engineering workflow _across all industries_   A lot of  interesting conversations related to the data stacks, data operations, data teams, modeling, testing, dashboards, etc. will be happening in the Meetup and it's definitely one you can't afford to miss out on!  Amazing speakers and interesting topics to look forward to include :   📌 Evolution of the Modern Data stack   📌Setting up a Modern Data stack from Scratch   📌Navigating the Remote global job market.   Now, register for the maiden edition coming October 14, 2021 in the link below, also share and invite others   https://www.meetup.com/lagos-dbt-meetup/",https://www.meetup.com/lagos-dbt-meetup/
